Assignment 3 - Persistence: Two-tier Web Application with Database, Express server, and CSS template
===

---

## Your Web Application Title

your glitch (or alternative server) link e.g. https://rustic-workable-baryonyx.glitch.me/

Student Database Management System with login functionality. Stores entries of students and whether they're passing or not.

- **The goal of the application:** To create a simplistic web application where users can login and enter data entries of students, and update them accordingly.
- **Challenges you faced in realizing the application:** My main challenge was getting MongoDB set up. In order to have it running on Glitch, you need to run 'node server.js' within the terminal on-site.
- **What authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable)**: I set up a single username-based login implementation system.
- **What CSS framework you used and why?:** I used Semantic UI because similar actual grading platforms like PowerSchool use it.


### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: "Describe how your site uses the CRAP principles in the Non-Designer's Design Book readings.
  Which element received the most emphasis (contrast) on each page?
  How did you use proximity to organize the visual information on your page?
  What design elements (colors, fonts, layouts, etc.) did you use repeatedly throughout your site?
  How did you use alignment to organize information and/or increase contrast for particular elements.
  Write a paragraph of at least 125 words *for each of four principles* (four paragraphs, 500 words in total)."
  - In my project, he most emphasized element on each page is the heading, such as the "Student Management System" title. I used a larger font size for these headers to make them stand out. Additionally, the buttons for actions like "Login," "Add/Update Student,", "Delete Student, etc. are styled using bold colors like green for adding and red for deleting. These colors are contrasting compared to the more neutral tones used in the background and input fields, resulting in the contrast making the important interactive elements easier to identify and creates something of a visual hierarchy where a prospective users' attention is immediately drawn to what is most important: interacting with the system via forms and buttons.
  - I applied proximity to organize visual information on the page. For example, the form elements are grouped closely together within the same form section, and the "Login" and "Add/Update Student" forms are distinct from one another and separated by headers. This spatial grouping ensures that users would intuitively understand which elements are part of the same functionality. Proximity in this layout helps reduce confusion by clearly segmenting the tasks into easy-to-understand sections.
  - I maintained repetition through consistent usage of fonts, button styles, and form layouts across all sections of my project. The font style used for the headings, inputs, and buttons remains uniform in order to ensure visual continuity and a professional appearance. Additionally, the button styles for different actions (like add, delete, and login, as stated above) are repeated with minor adjustments in color to signify their function, resulting in the user experience becoming more predictable and intuitive, as users learn that specific elements will behave similarly throughout the site.
  - In my project, elements are aligned to the left such that the form fields, buttons, and table content all line up vertically and create a tidy and professional appearance. The Semantic UI framework that I used has functionality that naturally aligns form elements, ensuring that input fields and buttons are visually pleasing and easy to navigate. This alignment helps to increase contrast by creating a clean layout where important elements stand out clearly.
