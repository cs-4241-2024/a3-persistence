## Workout Log with sessions

your glitch (or alternative server) link e.g. http://a3-cody-rueda.glitch.me

This application allows users to create an account to store workouts. Each user can only access their own data and can add edit and delete data. Users without an account will automatically create an account if they enter a username that is not currently saved. One challange I had was implementing sessions. I used a password based authenticity login function that checks MongoDB to see if that user exists and if it does if the password is correct. The CSS framework I used was tailwind due to the ease of implementaiton.
Include a very brief summary of your project here.

I used my one extension for this assignment.
