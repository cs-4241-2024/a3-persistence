the application uses Flexbox for positioning the form elements,

Add a Task: Fill in the task name, select a due date, choose a priority level, and click the "Add Task" button to add a new task to the list.
Modify a Task: Enter the existing task name you wish to modify, then provide the new details (task name, due date, priority), and click the "Modify Task" button.
View Tasks: All tasks are displayed in a table format under "Current Tasks," showing the task name, due date, priority, days remaining, and options to edit or delete tasks.
## Technical Achievements
