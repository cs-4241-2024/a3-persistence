## Car Inventory Management System 

Car Inventory Management system that allows you to enter the model, year, and MPG of the car. Additionally, there is a derived field "Age" that calculates how old the car is based on the year entered. The data you input shows up on a table that is dynamically generated and there is functionality that allows you to edit or delete existing entries. When the user first opens the application they land on a login page and after login they are directed to the main application. The application is also now connected to a database through MongoDB. The login and server set up was a little bit of a struggle. Also hosting on glitch is a struggle.
