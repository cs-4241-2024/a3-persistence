## Activity Tracker
https://a3-yunynl-1.onrender.com/


- Goal of the application: allow users to track their activities or tasks, each user can log in using Github OAuth.
- OAuth always not work for me 
- I chose to implement GitHub OAuth as the authentication strategy using Passport.js.


## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used OAuth authentication via the GitHub strategy
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Achieving 100% on Lighthouse Tests
- **Tech Achievement 3**: What’s Better about Render Compared to Glitch:
  Managed infrastructure: With Render, you don’t need to worry about server management, operating system updates, or security patches. Render automatically manages these for you, providing a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) environment.
  Scalability and flexibility: Render allows you to scale your applications easily. You can deploy multiple applications or services and scale vertically by upgrading your instance size.
  No app sleeping: Unlike Glitch (and Heroku’s free plan), apps on Render do not sleep when they are not in use, meaning your application will always be live and responsive.
  Seamless deployments: Render offers an easy, Git-based deployment process. You can automatically deploy from GitHub or GitLab, which simplifies CI/CD workflows.
- **Tech Achievement 4**: I used several Express.js middleware packages to enhance the functionality of the project:
1.passport.js: For OAuth authentication with GitHub.
2.express-session: For managing user sessions.
3.mongoose: To handle MongoDB connections and perform database operations.
4.connect-flash: To display flash messages to the user after login or logout.
5.body-parser: To parse incoming request bodies in JSON format.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I followed the following tips from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative.
