I have developed a clicking game that saves your scores. Users can also edit and delete scores as well. A challenge I faced was setting up the connection to my databse. I realized I had a small typo after lots of debugging was able to fix it. I used local-authentication with passport-local. I used boostrap because it is easy to use. 

Technical Acheivements:
I have acheived a 100 on all 4 categories for the lighthouse for desktop. 
5 middleware:
passport, passport-local, bycryptjs, express-session, mongoose.

Design Acheievements:

CRAP:
Contrast: I used contrast to help make my elements pop out. I used a light background to help make my buttons and text pop out. For example, I have buttons of birght color like green and red and I have that against a white background so that the buttons can stand out as much as possible. Furthermore, I have black text displaying things like the title and other stuff like the scores which is good against a white background so that it makes it extremeely easy for users to see. FInally I have made register and login in a bold font and made it large. This shows that importane of the words because they are the title of the page. ALl these parts help my application stand out. 

Repetition: 

For repetition I made a similar design all throughout the application. For example, I made a similar font that I used throughout the application because using the same font helps maintain a theme that looks better and makes the overall application higher quality. Furthermore, I used the same background as the color of white for simplicity and kept it the same so that it adds to the theme of the application. I made the layout repetitive for logging in and registering so that it makes it as easy to use for new users or players that want to try this game. If I were to have different designs all throughout the game, my game would be very hard to use because everything is super different.

Alignment: 
I used alignment to help make my application easy to use and make it look better. For example, all my content is aligned to the center to give the application a clearn look. Some input forms are aligned to the left to help for readability. Furthermore, logout and start game are next to each other to help mainain a good alignment acorss my application. This is important because if I used a bad alignment, I would have to figure out how to make the website easy to use because without alignment, it would be very difficult for users to find what they are looking for, and would overall decrease the quality of my website. The list of scores is aligned to help the user find all their scores which they can then edit and delete. 

Proximity:
I used proximity to help group related elements together. This improves the visual aspect of the game and makes it extremely user firendly. For example, the username and password fields on the login and registration forms are placed right above one another which makes it easy to find. If I didn't have proximity, users would have to be looking all around the page to find the necessary funcitonalty, which would decrease overall user satifciation of the game. Furthermore, I have the edit and delete buttons right next to each on the score so that users can find the right button they want to use depending on their purposes for each score. By organizing this content together, it makes the game extremely easy abd simple to play.
