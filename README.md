## My Computer Science Assignments :)

- a3-nrogerson234.glitch.me

This project is a single-page web application that allows users to manage their computer science assignments. Users can add new assignments, view the list of current assignments, edit existing assignments, and delete assignments. The application uses a form to submit data and dynamically updates the displayed data without requiring a page reload. The assignments include details such as the assignment name, points, score, and difficulty level. 

*I had issues with User Authentication so I focused more on getting SEO ratings of 100%.*

### Challenges Faced
- Ensuring secure authentication and session management.
- Handling asynchronous data updates and ensuring the UI reflects changes in real-time.
- Implementing a responsive and user-friendly interface.

### Authentication Strategy
I chose to use session-based authentication with a boolean `isAuthenticated` flag stored in the session. This approach was chosen for its simplicity and ease of implementation. Didn't work out as planned.

### CSS Framework
I used Bootstrap as the CSS framework for this project. Bootstrap was chosen because of its comprehensive set of pre-styled components and responsive grid system. Custom CSS was added to modify button colors and other UI elements to better fit the application's design.

### Express Middleware Packages
1. **express.urlencoded**: Parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads.
2. **cookie-session**: attempted to use. Manages session data using cookies.
3. **cors**: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the application.
4. **express.json**: Parses incoming requests with JSON payloads.
5. **express.static**: Serves static files from the `public` directory.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I completed the SEO rating of 100% as shown in the screenshot.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: None
