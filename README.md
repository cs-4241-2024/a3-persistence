## Description

This is a simple web application that allows users to add items to their grocery list. 

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application
- challenges you faced in realizing the application
- what authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable)
- what CSS framework you used and why
  - include any modifications to the CSS framework you made via custom CSS you authored
- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does. If you use a custom function for *one* (and one alone) middleware please 
add a little more detail about what it does.

## Technical Achievements
- **Implement OAuth Authentication**: I used OAuth authentication via the GitHub strategy in Passport.js
- **Host your site on a non-Glitch hosting service**: I used Netlify to host my site. It's better than Glitch because it updates on every push to your Github repository. Everything else is pretty similar to Glitch. Netlify deployment was slightly slowe than Glitch, however. I much prefer Netlify because of its UI/UX, ease, and convenience.
- **Get 100% on all four Lighthouse tests**: You can see the screenshot of the results below (I use Arc browser):
