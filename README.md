- the goal of the application: Organize your tasks 
- challenges you faced in realizing the application: Authentication
- what authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable): 
- what CSS framework you used and why
  - include any modifications to the CSS framework you made via custom CSS you authored
- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does. If you use a custom function for *one* (and one alone) middleware please 
add a little more detail about what it does.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Description of CRAP principles**: 

Contrast: 
In my site design, the principle of contrast is effectively utilized to guide viewer attention and enhance readability. Each page employs strong contrast between text and background colors to ensure content stands out. For instance, I opted for dark background on the login box on a lighter blue background, which not only improves legibility but also provides a clean aesthetic that reduces visual strain. The most emphasized element of contrast on each page is the headings, rendered in bolder typeface and darker color than the body text. This hierarchy draws the viewer’s eye and establishes clear structure within the content. Additionally, contrasting colors for buttons and calls to action ensure they stand out and invite interaction. This strategic use of contrast enhances usability and reinforces the overall visual identity of the site, making navigation intuitive.

Repetition: 
Repetition is a key principle in my site’s design, fostering consistency and cohesiveness across all pages. I chose a limited color palette featuring two primary colors—blue and white—along with a consistent font family that includes a sans-serif typeface for headings and a serif typeface for body text. This consistency in colors and fonts creates a recognizable brand identity and unifies different sections of the site. Layout elements, such as buttons and navigation bars, were designed with the same rounded corners and shadow effects, creating familiarity as users navigate the pages. Additionally, I repeated visual motifs, such as icons representing various sections, to reinforce the theme and enhance engagement. By implementing these repeated design elements, users can easily navigate the site while experiencing continuity throughout their interactions.

Proximity:
The principle of proximity is effectively used to organize visual information on my site, making it easier for users to digest content. By grouping related information together, I created a logical flow that enhances understanding. For instance, sections of text are accompanied by relevant images placed close by, allowing users to connect the visual elements with textual content effortlessly. This spatial organization helps prevent information overload by breaking large blocks of text into smaller, manageable segments. Additionally, I strategically utilized white space around these groupings to clarify relationships and guide the reader’s eye. Ensuring that items belonging together are positioned near each other improves overall layout and usability, facilitating a more intuitive navigation experience. This thoughtful application of proximity ultimately enhances user engagement with the content presented.

Alignment:
Alignment is another critical principle incorporated into my site’s design, enhancing both organization and visual appeal. Every element on the pages is carefully aligned to create a cohesive and polished look. Text blocks, images, and buttons are aligned either to the left or centered, establishing a grid-like structure that guides users through the content seamlessly. This intentional alignment improves readability and enhances the overall aesthetics of the site. To increase contrast, I used alignment to differentiate headings from body text; for example, headings are aligned left with a larger font size, while body text is aligned left but in a smaller size. This visual hierarchy draws attention to important information while maintaining a clean appearance. By implementing alignment thoughtfully, I ensured the site is functional and visually appealing, reinforcing user engagement with the content.
