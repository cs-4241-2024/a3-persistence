## Celtics Game Tracker

site: https://a3-brendan-byrne-byrnezy.glitch.me/

I created a tracker to help users track upcoming Celtics games, allowing them to log in, view, add, modify, and delete game schedules. It uses MongoDB for persistent storage, had challenges involving database connectivity and managing user-specific data when creating. Basic username-password authentication was implemented for simplicity, creating new accounts upon login if they don't exist. The application uses Bootstrap for styling, chosen for its ease of use and responsive design, with custom CSS modifications to match the Celtics theme—such as custom green colors, dark-themed game lists, and a refined form layout. The application will show the games on file and give you the choice to add or delete from the options.
