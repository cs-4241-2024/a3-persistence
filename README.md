Title: Clicking Game
I have created a game that allows users to click the button as many times as they can in 5 seconds and keeps track of their high score based off of therir name. 
To play the game, enter your name. Then click the start button, this will start the 5 second timer. then click the button as many times as you can. 
For css, I used a protest guerilla font on google fonts, i made the background black and the color white. Then I used a flex display on column to position the different parts of the game correctly. After, I set the font size of the title "Clicking Game" to 5em. I used flex for the portion that dipslays the data about thte users and their new high scores.  

Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.
What problems did the user have with your design?
What comments did they make that surprised you?
What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?

Participant 1: 
1. Last Name: Lewis
2. If the person doesn't input a name, my website should give an error.
3. I thought the design could be better but he actually thoguht it was simple and easy to play
4.  I would throw an error if no name was given, which means that users have to give a name


Participant 2: 
1. Last Name: Cash
2. If the user hits the start button multiple times, the game should restart
3. I thought that the game was self explanatory but he needed some guidance
4. I would add some instructions to the game even though I originally thought it was pretty easy to understand
