Project Summary
- The goal of my application is to allow individual users to keep track of the homework that they have to get done.
- A challenge I faced was mostly just time due to my other classes other than that it went pretty smoothly. I just porteed A2 to use MongoDB and added user accounts and data specific per user from there.
- The authenticatin strategy I used was to just store usernames and passwords in MongoDB. Pretty much it checks if the username exists in which case if it does exist it then checks if the password is correct and if it is logs the user in and if not has a popup alert letting the user know that their password was incorrect. In the case of a new username the username and password entered becomes a new user that then is stored in the database. I used this authentication strategy because it seemed the easiest to implement.
- The CSS framework that I used was Tacit CSS which I used because I liked the modern and simplistic look of it. I did not make any changes to it.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I hosted my website on Railway. The downside to Railway over Glitch is it is a lot less intuitive of how to set it up although it does seem to have more features and could probably host larger projacts than Glitch.
- **Tech Achievement 3**: I got 100% in all categoried on Google Lighthouse. See lighthouse.png for an image of the results.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- I did not do any design achievements due to my workload and time constraints.
