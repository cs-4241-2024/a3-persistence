## Persistent D&D Wizard Spell Slot Tracker

Glitch link: a3-thomas-oleary.glitch.me

- Be capable of displaying the spell slot usage of a Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Wizard, showing unique and consistent data for each user
- My A2 project was a little extra with the automatic table making. It was a bit of a pain to carry everything over into express and then into MongoDB. It also led to some odd parts of my project, like how I stored each row of the table per user in separate objects.
- I used a username and password authentication strategy because it seemed easiest and is the most commonplace.
- I used Pico, a minimal framework. I really enjoy putting all of my devices into dark mode, and I really love the look Pico provides. I think it looks technical enough to match the numbers it is displaying while also not being overly extravagant.
