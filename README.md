Inflation* Over Time

-------your glitch (or alternative server) link e.g. http://a3-charlie-roberts.glitch.me

The goal of this application is to be a very simple prototype for
a cost projection application. If I had worked on it longer, I
might have used different inflation rates for certain kinds of
products, to make it a way for people to list some of their products
and see how much they're worth today. I faced a few main challenges,
mainly with integrating mongodb and cookies into the application.
For authentication, I just used usernames and passwords with cookies
to keep users logged in over periods, just because the code for it
seemed pretty simple. I used the bootstraps CSS framework, mostly because I heard that it was good for simple designs,
but I didn't like the end product very much. I didn't make any modifications to
the framework.
