## Skyler's Sushi Bar
This tool is for sending ordering information into a server's database. So, even refreshing the page will not clear the data as it has been stored. Using this tool would be useful to for a cashier who needs to grab and store info on every one of their customers. This would also be helpful for the cashier and manager to communicate on the income and profits made for the day at this resturant. Cash total adds up the previous orders' money made to form a sum total. Item total is also a sum of all items added and submitted in the cart. Thank you for stopping by!

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I created a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data. When the user submits data, the server responds by  sending back the updated data and the client can update its data display.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

2. What problems did the user have with your design?
The primary issue the user encountered with my design was the phone number input section. They felt it lacked clarity and suggested adding placeholder values to guide them in inputting the correct 10 digits. This would prevent any confusion and ensure that the form is filled out properly. Additionally, they had some thoughts on the overall user experience in terms of the design. For instance, they mentioned adding more engaging UI elements, like a "toast" notification system. This would provide immediate feedback without disrupting the user’s flow. They suggested putting a subtle, fade-away popup messages for notifications, which they thought would enhance the interactive aspect.

3. What comments did they make that surprised you?
I was surprised by how insightful their comments were regarding the use of the toast UI design. I hadn't initially considered how impactful these subtle design changes could be on the overall experience. It made me realize that what I thought was a minor detail could actually have a significant influence on how users interact with the application.

4. What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
Based on their feedback, I would definitely implement both the design and technical suggestions they provided. Adding placeholder values would be an easy yet effective change that could streamline the user experience. The fade-away popups would also create a more polished and dynamic interface. Their input has made me reconsider how I approach both the user experience and interface design, especially when it comes to smaller, detail-oriented improvements that can make a big difference in usability.

Zeng

2. What problems did the user have with your design?
One of the design issues she pointed out was that the overall look of the website felt too plain. She mentioned that the black-and-white color scheme made the site feel a bit dull and suggested adding some color to make the interface more visually appealing. Samantha recommended incorporating a few accent colors. On the technical side, she noticed that the form validation wasn’t as helpful as it could be. The error messages only appeared after submitting the entire form, which could frustrate users. She suggested implementing real-time validation which can prevent submission errors and saving time.

3. What comments did they make that surprised you?
What surprised me about her comments was how much the lack of color affected her perception of the site’s quality. I thought the minimalist black-and-white design would come across as modern, but she made me realize that it also risks feeling uninviting or boring for some users.

4. What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
Based on her feedback, I would adjust the design by introducing a better color palette to add some vibrancy to the website. Even just adding a few accent colors in places could make the interface more visually interesting. On the technical side, I would implement real-time form validation to make the process smoother. This way, they would be alerted to any input errors as they type.
