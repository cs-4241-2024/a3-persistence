## To-Do Manager
My project is a To-Do manager which will keep track of all the assignments you have to do. You give it a title a due date and a priority you give to the assignment and it will calculate the urgency you need to give to that assignment. This is based on the due date and the priority given, if the due date is 2 or fewer days from the current date it will add +5 to the urgency if it's 7 or fewer days from the current date it will add +2 and the rest will just give +1 urgency. If it's a high priority add 5 if it's medium add 3 and low will add 1 to the total urgency of that task. For this assignment, I used the CSS framework of Pure and was able to complete all required tasks.

## Credentials
- **Username**: Test
- **Password**: password

OR

- Use GitHub login.

## Technical Achievements
- **Implement OAuth authentication**: Â I was able to integrate GitHub login after a lot of research and specifying the route of my application on Git Hub. After getting the app to be hosted on render I had to change some settings for the callback wich made it time consuming. 

- **Middleware Used**:  Body parser for making the JSON easier to access, express-session to manage the session of the user accessing the site(cookies), passport and passport-github2 for handling authentication through third-party apps. 

- **Hosted Application on Railway**: Used Render.com to host my application. Of course, I prefer using Glitch because is the one I have used the most but Railway makes it very easy to import projects and see projects on your account. Render also makes it simple but if you leave the VM unactive it takes a while to load so this is a large downfall. Also tried railway but kept getting some weird 502 errors.
