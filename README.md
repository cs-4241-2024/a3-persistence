This web application takes in a name and the likes of that name and gives them a "cool" rating based on what they liked. Used Pico CSS framework for a minimalistic + dark mode approach.
Can currently get documents from DB but can't write to it. Uses a log-in system that checks the database for matching username/password pairs and associates all following inputs with that document's ID.
This was done as it was an easy way to implement authentication.
