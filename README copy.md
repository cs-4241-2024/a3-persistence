## Workout Tracker
My project is a workout tracker where you can enter the name of an exercise, how many repititions were completed and how many sets were completed. The submit button will add new data to the server. The clear button will remove all stored values and the delete button will remove a single row of data. I used the flexbox center alligned with a column format for my CSS positioning technique.


## Technical Achievements
- **Single Page App**: My application is one page and updates everytime a workout is added or deleted

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Think aloud protocol**: I met with two student that tested my user interface.

Q1: Kalavantis
Q2: One problem she had with my desgin was that I am actually using two different tables so it makes the data display look off. (I fixed this since meeting with her)
Q3: One comment she made that suprised my was how she mentioned how easy it was to enter exercises quickly due to the submit button focusing on the input removing the need to use the mouse for entering data.
Q4: She noticed that the only way to see the data stored in the server after refreshing the page is to add more data. I should probably make a button to show current logged data.

Q1: Dang
Q2: One problem he had with my desgin was that the data was hidden until the first entry was submitted
Q3: One comment he made was that it was repititve to have a column in the table that says edit and delete and that the data should be in the table and the buttons next to it on the side.
Q4: Based on his feedback I would remove the buttons from the table I would also put the submit and clear buttons side by side. Finally I will make the table show onload so you can see existing data. (I made an onload function to fix this)
